I have created a festival tracker that gives a list of music festivals. 
There are a number of things that I have had trouble with but as I worked through the cli project I realized that google was my bestfriend. 
-nokogiri
-open-uri
-pry or byebug
-scraping data

Were all things that I spent the most time on. 
I learned that using byebug was easier than using pry. 
I successfully scraped data in my scraper class
