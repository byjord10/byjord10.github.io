It all started with the joys of updating my page on MySpace. Yes, I went that far back. It took me some time to come to the conclusion that I should get into Web Developing but I am here and ready to fall back into that rabbit hole of coding that I am familiar with. After graduating from the Software Engineer Bootcamp, I would like to persue Flatiron School's UI/UX program so that I can really be advanced and one day be one of many people to help create a dope website that the world can enjoy.
