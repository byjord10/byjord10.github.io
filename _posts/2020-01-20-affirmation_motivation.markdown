Graduating is a top priority for just about everyone here and I could'nt help but to write about how important it is to celebrate your current position in life. 

As some could relate, this particular program is so different from the career I originally wanted to persue. I majored in Biology and at that time had no idea the amount of love I had for tech. So here I am, learning Ruby and a few weeks away from building my first CLI application and I am astonished at how far I have come. 
Come on, this is wild! And I enjoy every part of the learning process. 

I frequently search job oppurtunities that are in my area and it inspires me to do my own research on the topics we cover. I get a boost of motivation to keep going. I have also suscribed to a few channels on Youtube, who are Software Engineers, to get advice and see first-hand what it is like to be a Developer. In a way, this is how I celebrate my future as a Full Stack Developer. Affirming a career that I can enjoy. 

Im saying all of this to say, celebrate your milestones! Celebrating can be a great motivator, for you have come so far. Words of affirmation will give you that motivation to help you push through.
